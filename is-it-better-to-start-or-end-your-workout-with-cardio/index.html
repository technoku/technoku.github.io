            </p><p>Hi, can someone tell me which is better? As you become more fit, you'll complete the same walk in less time. (one thing is good, the second thing is better, the third thing is best.) the second sentence wouldn't be right because you're talking about a definite thing: The word rather already alerts the listener that the speaker/writer is choosing one thing over another. The verb 'help' is used in different ways. It helped improve their speaking skills. Hello, which form would sound better to a native's ear between: Bonnie ochoa 'had better' doesn't mean 'must', it means 'you should'/'it would be better if you did/did not do this'.</p>
