        <p>I can’t recall a precise. The word rather already alerts the listener that the speaker/writer is choosing one thing over another. I have a little doubt about this sentence because of its use of “more fit”:</p>

    <br/>
        <p>It helped improve their speaking skills. I have (up until yesterday) put it on the second line as andygc showed. The verb 'help' is used in different ways.</p>

    <br/>
        <p>It doesn&#039;t sound formal enough to be used in an essay. You would better can be shortened to you&#039;d better but then it&#039;s either the conditional of to better, meaning to do better than someone, as in 1. As you become more fit, you&#039;ll complete the same walk in less time.</p>
            <h3>Hi, Can Someone Tell Me Which Is Better?</h3>
