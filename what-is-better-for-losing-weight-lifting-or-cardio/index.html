            </p><p>Hello everyone, there are three things i did well. The word rather already alerts the listener that the speaker/writer is choosing one thing over another. So, if you say you'd rather do something soon, the obvious implication is. I have (up until yesterday) put it on the second line as andygc showed. As you become more fit, you'll complete the same walk in less time. 'had better' is a fixed expression and it is always followed by a. (one thing is good, the second thing is better, the third thing is best.) the second sentence wouldn't be right because you're talking about a definite thing: I have a little doubt about this sentence because of its use of “more fit”:</p>
