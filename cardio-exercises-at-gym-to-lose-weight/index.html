The food waste is not degraded and bacteria/bugs in soil will try to degraded some while releasing bad smell. 19 i'm experimenting with growing my own food, and have been for a few years now. I recently bought some tree fertilizer spikes to feed my potted dwarf kumquat and lime trees. Even if the seeds are viable (immature pepper seeds can be grown if planted soon after harvesting, but don't have the food storage for long.
