            </p><p>I have a blank gray page with a bing search in the middle. I know how to minimize it, but how does one get rid of even the text headlines entirely? I love bing, but how can i get rid of (not just minimise but permanently) that horrible popular now bar at the bottom? Each day, bing’s editorial team. I would also like to include other popular search engines as bing. Still chad greenway, carole king, slender man stabbing, sasha shulgin, rihanna. Microsoft has added a new ‘popular now’ section to its bing search engine in the us, uk, germany and france, a feature designed to let you see daily news trends by glancing. Google has the tool google trends to research changes in search frequency of specific keywords over time.</p>
