            </p><p>The pyramids of egypt stand as monumental testaments to the ingenuity and ambition of ancient egyptian civilization. They were once grand tombs for the pharaohs. Pharaoh khufu was the first egyptian king to build a pyramid in giza, a project he began in circa 2550 b.c. Around 2780 bce, king djoser's architect, imhotep, built the first pyramid by placing six mastabas, each smaller than the one beneath, in a stack to form a pyramid rising in steps. As far as is known so far, the first pyramid in egypt was a stepped pyramid built by djoser about the year 2630 bc. It is inserted in the history of egypt between the beginning of the old kingdom and the end of the second intermediate period, with an apogee during the old. Here is the story of these pyramids. Major pyramids located here include the pyramid of djoser—generally identified as the world's oldest substantial monumental structure to be built of dressed stone—the pyramid of userkaf,.</p>
